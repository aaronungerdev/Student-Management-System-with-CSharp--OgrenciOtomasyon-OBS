The database folder contains MDF, LDF, and SQL files. You can easily add the database from MSSQL. The naming conventions have been done in Turkish.

This project focuses on the design and development of a small-scale student automation 
system using C#, MSSQL, Visual Studio, and Windows Forms. The aim of the project is to 
create an automation system for university students to effectively manage their academic
processes. First, the project requirements and user needs were analyzed, and then the
design phase began. Subsequently, form screens were created and made functional using
the C# programming language and Visual Studio development environment. MSSQL 
database management system was used to create database tables and establish 
relationships. Finally, the system was tested and any errors were fixed. The findings obtained 
at the end of the study demonstrated that the designed student automation system was
successfully implemented and helped students effectively manage their academic 
processes. Through an easy-to-use interface, students can select courses and view their 
grades. Efficient management of academic processes enables students to have a more 
productive educational experience. This project highlights the convenience of using
technologies such as C#, MSSQL, Visual Studio, and Windows Forms in such projects.
